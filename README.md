You can use the following tags anywhere in the botâ€™s response:

Tag | Meaning

`<*>` | Matches anything, including whitespaces
`<WORD>` | A single word without whitespaces
`<(REGEX)>` | Any regex expression, i.e. `<([0-9]{2})>`
`<$VARNAME>` | An expression from the locale/translation file

You can match one or more attachments **on their own, or at the end** of the
response:

Tag | Meaning

## Usage

You must have a config file `autobot.yml` in the current directory or a parent directory.

```
$ autobot

  Usage: autobot [options] <chatPath>

  autobot is an multi-platform bot testing framework. It requires an autobot.yml config file to be in the working directory or a parent.


  Options:

    -V, --version               output the version number
    -v --verbose                Enable full logging including bot queries and responses
    -j --json                   Enable seeing the direct JSON responses from the client
    -c, --config <autobot.yml>  autobot.yml config file to use (default current directory and parents)
    -h, --help                  output usage information
```

To run a specific test:

```
$ autobot ./path/to/test.yml
```

To run all tests recursively in a directory:

```
$ autobot ./path/to/directory
```

To see the dialogue in the console, add the `-v` flag

```
$ autobot -v ./path/to/test.yml

	Discovered 1 tests (1 branches)

  HUMAN testuser-simple-0: Hello
  BOT testuser-simple-0: Hi!
```

## Config File Format

The config file `autobot.yml` takes the following fields:

```
client: botframework
directLineSecret: <SECRET IF USING BOT FRAMEWORK>
localeFiles:
  - locale/en/locale.json
timeout: 20000 (timeout in ms)
preamble:
  - Human: Hey there
  - Bot: <*>
  - Human: Hi
```

## Extending to a new platforms

autobot is designed to be super simple to integrate a new platform. You only need to implement the `Client` interface
found in `src/clients/client_interface.ts`, in either javascript or typescript. 

There are only 2 mandatory methods, and 2 optional methods to implement:

```
export class MyNewClient extends Client {
  send(message) {
    // Mandatory
  }

  onReply(callback) {
    // Mandatory
  }

  onReady(callback) {
    // Optional
  }

  close() {
    // Optional
  }
}
```
